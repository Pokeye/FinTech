# FinTech Platform Dashboard

A responsive Bootstrap 5 dashboard that unifies crypto analytics, stock profiling, banking ops, and cybersecurity telemetry. This project rebrands an open financial dashboard template into a FinTech-first experience with refreshed metadata, copy, and data integrations.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – primary dashboard overview
- `pages/` – secondary views (payments, transactions, wallet, investment, stocks & funds, community, documentation, support, authentication suite, component library)
- `assets/css` – global, component, and responsive styles
- `assets/js` – core JavaScript plus vendor integrations
- `lib/` – bundled third-party libraries (Bootstrap, Font Awesome, ApexCharts, Chart.js, DataTables, etc.)

## Getting Started
1. Install Node.js (LTS recommended).
2. From the project root run `npm install` to restore development tooling.
3. Use `npm run dev` for local previews or `npm run build` to produce optimized assets.
4. Update `assets/js/main.js` if you need to adjust caching intervals, polling cadence, or feature flags.

If you skip the Node/Gulp toolchain you can still open the HTML files directly, but the build scripts ensure minified assets and consistent behavior with production.

## Live Data Integrations
FinTech Platform demonstrates how to stitch together multiple financial data providers. Replace the demo keys and URLs with your own credentials before shipping.

| Provider | Purpose | Environment Variables |
|----------|---------|-----------------------|
| CoinGecko | Crypto market prices, top movers, asset metadata | `COINGECKO_API_URL` (optional override), `COINGECKO_CACHE_TTL` |
| Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) | Stock fundamentals, ratios, news | `FMP_API_KEY`, `FMP_API_URL`, `FMP_CACHE_TTL` |
| Optional Banking APIs | Balance snapshots, ACH / wire status | `BANKING_API_URL`, `BANKING_API_KEY`, `BANKING_API_TTL` |

### Configuration Notes
- Store secrets in `.env` (not committed) and load them through your build tooling or serverless platform.
- Set sensible cache TTLs (e.g., crypto 60s, equities 300s) to avoid rate limits.
- Review provider SLAs—CoinGecko is rate-limited per IP, while FMP requires a paid tier for high-frequency queries.
- The demo includes fallback JSON for offline usage; keep or remove it depending on your deployment.

## Vendor Licenses
- Bootstrap 5 (MIT)
- Font Awesome Free (CC BY 4.0)
- ApexCharts (MIT)
- Chart.js (MIT)
- DataTables (MIT / GPLv2 dual)

Bundle updates in `lib/` if you need security patches or new features. Verify compatibility before upgrading.

## Branding Checklist Before Launch
- Replace logo assets in `assets/images/logo/`
- Confirm color tokens in `assets/css/global.css`
- Update metadata (title, OG tags) across each HTML page
- Refresh footer credits in every file comments block if you fork further

## Support & Maintenance
We provide community-based bug triage inside the docs/support pages. For production use, assign an internal owner for:
- Incident response and alerting
- API key rotation and access reviews
- Dependency upgrades
- Accessibility & performance audits
